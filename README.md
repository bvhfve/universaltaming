# Universal Taming Mod

## 🎯 The Ultimate Universal Taming Experience

**Universal Taming** is the most ambitious and technically advanced universal taming mod ever created for Minecraft. Our revolutionary approach enables taming of **ANY mob** while preserving their exact original appearance and giving them perfect wolf-like AI behavior.

### 🔥 Core Philosophy: "Every Mob Gets Its Own Perfect Renderer"

Unlike other taming mods that compromise on visual quality or behavior, Universal Taming creates **individual entity classes for every single mob type** in the game, ensuring:

- **Perfect Visual Preservation**: Tamed entities look exactly like their vanilla counterparts
- **Perfect Behavioral Preservation**: All tamed entities behave exactly like vanilla wolves
- **Perfect Data Compatibility**: Full `/data get entity` compatibility with wolf-like data structures
- **Zero Compromises**: No visual artifacts, no behavioral inconsistencies, no performance issues

## 🏗️ Revolutionary Architecture

### Individual Entity System
Instead of using a generic dynamic system, we create unique classes for each mob:

- **TamedCowEntity** - Perfect cow appearance with wolf-like AI
- **TamedPigEntity** - Perfect pig appearance with wolf-like AI  
- **TamedSheepEntity** - Perfect sheep appearance with wolf-like AI
- **TamedZombieEntity** - Perfect zombie appearance with wolf-like AI
- **[50+ more individual entities]** - One for each mob type

### Individual Renderer System
Each entity gets its own renderer based on vanilla patterns:

- **TamedCowEntityRenderer** - Uses vanilla cow rendering patterns
- **TamedPigEntityRenderer** - Uses vanilla pig rendering patterns
- **TamedSheepEntityRenderer** - Uses vanilla sheep rendering patterns
- **[50+ more individual renderers]** - Perfect visual preservation for all

### Wolf-Like AI System
Every tamed entity behaves exactly like a vanilla wolf:

```java
// When you use /data get entity on ANY tamed mob, you see:
Wolf has the following entity data: {
    Brain: {memories: {}}, 
    Owner: [I; -798559876, -823380661, -1815467092, 1532164499], 
    Sitting: 1b, 
    CollarColor: 14b, 
    Health: 40.0f, 
    attributes: [
        {id: "minecraft:max_health", base: 40.0d}, 
        {id: "minecraft:movement_speed", base: 0.30000001192092896d}, 
        {id: "minecraft:follow_range", base: 16.0d}
    ]
    // ... complete wolf-like data structure
}
```

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 Perfect Visual Preservation
- **Identical Appearance**: Tamed entities are visually indistinguishable from vanilla
- **Original Models**: Uses exact vanilla entity models with all animations
- **Original Textures**: Uses exact vanilla entity textures with all variants
- **Original Layers**: Preserves all vanilla rendering layers and effects

### 🧠 Advanced Wolf-Like AI
- **Sitting/Standing**: Right-click to toggle like vanilla wolves
- **Smart Following**: Intelligent pathfinding with teleportation when needed
- **Combat System**: Attack hostiles, defend owner, coordinated pack attacks
- **Loyalty System**: Never despawn, always return to owner
- **Health System**: Wolf-like health with regeneration

### 📊 Complete Data Compatibility
- **Wolf NBT Format**: Full compatibility with vanilla wolf data structures
- **Command Support**: `/data get entity` shows proper wolf-like data
- **Brain/Memory**: Implements wolf-like brain and memory systems
- **Attributes**: Wolf-like attributes (health, speed, follow range)

### 🎮 Enhanced Gameplay
- **Universal Taming**: One item tames all supported entities
- **Gift System**: Tamed entities occasionally bring gifts to owner
- **Stat Tracking**: Kill count, death count, experience gained
- **Breeding System**: Tamed entities can breed with each other
